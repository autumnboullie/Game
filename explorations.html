 <h1> Board game </h1>
    <p>
       For the board game we tried to figure out a game that was fun and took a while to finish, which was very challenging because we had a 
       very small board and not many spaces to move through.

<h2> 2D Video Game</h2>
<p>
 The video game was really complicated to understand. I made the game work but I didnt actually understand the code I was writing.
